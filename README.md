## Build Instructions

Prerequisites:
- Qt 6 (Widgets, Sql) or Qt 5.15+
- CMake 3.16+
- A C++17 compiler (GCC 9+/Clang 10+)

On Ubuntu/Debian (example):
```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install -y cmake g++ qtbase5-dev qtbase5-dev-tools libqt5sql5 sqlite3
# For Qt6 instead of Qt5:
# sudo apt install -y qt6-base-dev qt6-base-dev-tools
```

Configure and build:
```bash
cmake -S . -B build -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
cmake --build build -j
./build/Notes
```

### Building a .deb Package (Recommended for Installation)

For easy system-wide installation, you can build a Debian package:

#### Prerequisites for .deb building:
```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install -y build-essential devscripts debhelper dh-make
```

#### Build the .deb package:
```bash
# From the project root directory
dpkg-buildpackage -b -us -uc
```

#### Install the .deb package:
```bash
# The .deb file will be created in the parent directory
sudo dpkg -i ../notes_0.1.0-1_amd64.deb

# If there are dependency issues, run:
sudo apt-get install -f
```

#### Alternative: Build and install in one command:
```bash
# Build and install directly
sudo dpkg-buildpackage -b -us -uc && sudo dpkg -i ../notes_0.1.0-1_amd64.deb
```

After installation, you can:
- **Launch from System Menu**: Search for "Notes" in your applications menu
- **Run from Terminal**: Type `notes` from any directory
- **Desktop Shortcut**: Right-click desktop ‚Üí Create Launcher ‚Üí Application: `notes`
- **Uninstall**: `sudo apt remove notes` (removes all files cleanly)
- **Update**: `sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade notes` (when new versions are available)

#### What the .deb package includes:
- **Binary**: `/usr/bin/notes` - The main application executable
- **Desktop Entry**: `/usr/share/applications/notes.desktop` - Application launcher
- **Icons**: Multiple resolution icons in `/usr/share/icons/hicolor/`
- **Dependencies**: Automatically handles Qt and SQLite dependencies

#### Package Information:
- **Package Name**: `notes`
- **Version**: `0.1.0-1`
- **Architecture**: `amd64`
- **Section**: `utils`
- **Priority**: `optional`
- **Status**: ‚úÖ **Successfully Installed** (as of latest build)

#### Installation Verification:
```bash
# Check if installed
dpkg -l | grep notes

# Check executable location
which notes

# List installed files
dpkg -L notes

# Test launch
notes
```

#### Troubleshooting .deb Build Issues:

**Error: "dpkg-buildpackage: command not found"**
```bash
sudo apt install -y build-essential devscripts debhelper dh-make
```

**Error: "Cannot find debian/rules"**
```bash
# Make sure you're in the project root directory
ls debian/rules
```

**Error: "Build dependencies not satisfied"**
```bash
# Install build dependencies
sudo apt build-dep .
```

**Error: "Package has unmet dependencies"**
```bash
# After installing the .deb, fix dependencies
sudo apt-get install -f
```

**Clean build environment:**
```bash
# Remove previous build artifacts
dpkg-buildpackage -b -us -uc -tc
```
